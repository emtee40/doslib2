Applies to all platforms.

#if defined(...) #ifdef and etc work normally in C/C++.
However in an inline assembly block, only #ifdef works properly.

Noted problem code:

__asm {
#if TARGET_BITS == 16
... Code A
#else
... Code B
#endif
}

Even when compiled with TARGET_BITS == 32, only Code A was assembled into the program
