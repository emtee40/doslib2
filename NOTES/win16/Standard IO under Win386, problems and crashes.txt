ISSUE: using fprintf/getchar/gets with standard I/O under Windows 3.1 Win386
TARGETS: 16-bit Windows (win16), 32-bit Windows (win386)
NOTED BY: Jonathan Campbell

Win386 programs are generally able to make use of fopen/etc. however if they
fprintf to stderr or attempt to read from stdin, Watcom's 386 extender crashes
and dumps the screen to text mode.

Workaround: don't use stdin/stdout/stderr or stdin/stdout/stderr IO handles.
if you can't get your code to do that, then close the handles or open NUL
and dup2() them over the standard I/O handles.
