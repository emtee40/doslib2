ISSUE: Windows 3.0 runs Win16 applications on Ring 1, not Ring 3
TARGETS: 16-bit Windows (win16)
NOTED BY: Jonathan Campbell

Some debugging with DOSBox has revealed that, if you are writing
Win16 code to hook exceptions, you will cause crashes and
instability IF you fail to take into account the privilege
level your code is running on.

This can happen if the code assumes that it is running on ring 3.
Under Windows 3.1 and later, this is true. Windows 3.0 however,
runs applications on Ring 1 (CPL=1).

This is most likely to happen in any case where you are creating
selectors and using them for exception handlers, data pointers,
etc.
