If your code is targeting Windows 2.0 and higher, you can trust Windows not to
execute your code if the "expected version" field represents a version newer
than the version running.

Windows 1.0 however, does not seem to pay attention to that field. It will
happily run Windows 2.x executables (which usually work fine since both
are real mode). But keep it in mind.
