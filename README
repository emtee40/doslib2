DOS Library #2
A cleanup/rewrite of DOSLIB
(C) 2012 Jonathan Campbell

I will continue to develop and expand DOSLIB, don't worry. But DOSLIB will
have it's place only as an experimental test bed for design and programming,
while DOSLIB2 is intended to be a more refined, optimized rewrite.



Choice of host operating system:

You will need a Linux system to compile this source tree. I may expand out
to other build environments if time permits.


Choice of make tool:

I will be using GNU make in this branch.


Compile time requirements:

- Perl 5.10
- Open Watcom 1.9 (runnable on Linux, installed in /usr/watcom-1.9)
- GNU C compiler
- NASM Netwide Assembler 2.09.10 or higher



Compile targets:

This version of the DOSLIB will target most or all of the same targets,
with the addition of producing executable tools for your host Linux system.
Additional targets will be made to accomodate a new memory resident design
of the library where instead of including the functions within the EXE,
those portions of the library can remain memory resident instead. This is
obviously to reduce EXE size and avoid needless re-detecting the hardware,
but that target is obviously not desireable in some cases, so both are
retained instead. A similar idea will be implemented in Windows and OS/2
builds putting library functions in an external DLL if desired, and possibly
even keeping DLL modules resident for persistence.

See TARGETS for more information.
