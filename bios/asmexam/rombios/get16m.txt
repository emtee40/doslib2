GET16M.COM

  Captures to disk the contents of whatever is visible at the top 16MB of
  addressable RAM or ROM. Uses flat real mode to do so, which requires a
  386 or higher. On a 386SX, 16MB is the total amount of external RAM or
  ROM accessible, and therefore, the ROM BIOS is visible just under the
  16MB limit.

  To capture the top 16MB of a 286-based system, use GET16286.COM which will
  avoid the use of 386 instructions and utilize 286 protected mode to grab
  that memory.

Target hardware:

  Old 386SX systems with less than 16MB of RAM. Some 386DX or even old 486
  systems may also tie off address lines and have a 16MB limit.

Not recommended for:

  - Windows or OS/2 "DOS boxes". Windows mucks with the adapter ROM area and
    maps things in there like system structures, etc. A snapshot from within
    a DOS box would produce an incorrect capture.

  - 386/486 systems with 16MB or more of RAM. In this case the system can
    obviously address 16MB or more of RAM and therefore the ROM BIOS is not
    likely sitting below the 16MB mark. This program would only end up
    capturing whatever system RAM happened to be there which is not useful.

  - Pentium or newer systems. Most likely system memory exists just below 16MB.
    If something from the ISA bus IS there, it's probably some ISA device
    visible through the ISA hole that PCI chipsets typically offer at 15-16MB.

Recommendations:

  - Use only for 386SX or 486 systems that have less than 15MB of RAM and
    tend to alias every 16MB.

  - This program allows snapshotting 15-16MB for completeness. Every on 386SX
    systems the same thing can be read from just under 4GB, in which case
    use GET4G.COM.

Notes:

  - CompuAdd 320nx laptop: I'm pretty sure the CPU is a 386SX, and yet an
    alias of the BIOS is not visible at just under 16MB?
