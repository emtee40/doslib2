Problem: MS-DOS 2.2 copy is non-bootable (DAMN IT)

How to force it:
 - Boot from MS-DOS 3.3
 - Switch to the 2.2 disk
 - Use fdisk on 2.2 to partition the hard drive
 - Use format on 3.3 to format the hard drive (the TeleVideo 2.2
   FORMAT seems to do nothing).
 - SYS.COM on 2.2 bails out with "incorrect DOS version" (DAMN IT)
   however a full copy of the boot sector is visible in SYS.COM
   from 0x8E7-0xAE6.

   Method 2: Patch SYS.COM to ignore DOS version.
   Write 14 bytes of 0x90 (NOP) to offset (0x64) in the file aka 
   offset (0x164) in memory segment. This replaces:

   CMP AX,0x020B
   JBE 0x172
   MOV DX,0x05C1
   MOV AH,0x09
   INT 0x21
   INT 0x20

   Unfortunately patching does not resolve the issue that SYS.COM
   does not recognize your MS-DOS 3.3 bootdisk as a system disk.

Basically, the idiot who uploaded the disk image failed to account
for the fact that, yes, it's MS-DOS 2.2, but it's not bootable,
and the tools are too picky to even begin allowing the user to
format and partition the hard disk to boot from. The only hope I
have is in manually extracting the boot sector from SYS.COM and
then writing it myself to the boot sector.
